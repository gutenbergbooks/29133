<div class="bk2"><h1><b>shipwreck<br />
in<br />
the<br />
sky</b></h1>

<h2><small><i>by ... Eando Binder</i></small></h2>

<p class="pr1"><big><b>The flight into space that made
Pilot-Capt. Dan Barstow famous.</b></big></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">The flight</span> was listed at
GHQ as <i>Project Songbird</i>. It was
sponsored by the Space Medicine
Labs of the U.S. Air Force. And
its pilot was Captain Dan Barstow.</p>

<p>A hand-picked man, Dan Barstow,
chosen for the AF's most
important project of the year because
he and his VX-3 had already
broken all previous records
set by hordes of V-2s, Navy
Aerobees and anything else that
flew the skyways.</p>

<p>Dan Barstow, first man to
cross the sea of air and sight
open, unlimited space. Pioneer
flight to infinity. He grinned and
hummed to himself as he settled
down for the long jaunt. Too
busy to be either thrilled or
scared he considered the thirty-seven
instruments he'd have to
read, the twice that many records
to keep, and the miles of
camera film to run. He had been
hand-picked and thoroughly conditioned
to take it all without
more than a ten percent increase
in his pulse rate. So he worked
as matter-of-factly as if he were
down in the Gs Centrifuge of
the Space Medicine Labs where
he had been schooled for this trip
for months.</p>

<p>He kept up a running fire of
oral reports through his helmet
radio, down to Rough Rock and
his CO. "All Roger, sir ...
temperature falling fast but this
rubberoid space suit keeps me
cozy, no chills ... Doc Blaine
will be happy to hear that!
Weightless sensations pretty queer
and I feel upside-down as much
as rightside-up, but no bad effects....
Taking shots of the
sun's corona now with color
film ... huh? Oh, yes, sir, it's
beautiful all right, now that you
mention it. But, hell, sir, who's
got the time for aesthetics now?...
Oops, <i>that</i> was a close one!
Tenth meteor whizzing past.
Makes me think of flak back
on those Berlin bombing runs."</p>

<p>Dan couldn't help wincing
when the meteors peppered down
past. The "flak" of space. Below
he could see the meteors
flare up brightly as they hit the
atmosphere. Most of those near
his position were small, none
bigger than a baseball, and Dan
took comfort in the fact that his
rocket was small too, in the immensity
around him. A direct
hit would be sheer bad luck, but
the good old law of averages was
on his side.</p>

<p>"Yes, Colonel, this tin can I'm
riding is holding together okay,"
Dan continued to Rough Rock.
If he paused even a second in his
reports a top-sergeant's yell from
the Colonel's throat came back
for him to keep talking. Every
bit of information he could transmit
to them was a vital revelation
in this USAF-Alpha
exploration of open space beyond
Earth's air cushion, with ceiling
unlimited to infinity.</p>

<p>"Cosmic rays, sir? Sure, the
reading shot up double on the
Geiger ... huh? Naw, I don't
feel a thing ... like Doc Baird
suspected, we invented a lot of
Old Wives' Tales in <i>advance</i>, before
going into space. I feel fine,
so you can put down cosmic ray
intensity as a Boogey Man....
What's that? Yeah, yeah, sir, the
stars shine without winking up
here. What else?... Space is
inky black&mdash;no deep purples or
queer more-than-blacks like some
jetted-up writers dreamed up&mdash;just
plain old ordinary dead
black. Earth, sir?... Well, it
does look dish-shaped from up
here, concave.... Sure, I can
see all the way to Europe and&mdash;say!
Here's something unexpected.
I can see that hurricane
off the coast of Florida.... You
said it, sir! Once we install
permanent space stations up here
it will be easy to spot typhoons,
volcano eruptions, tidal waves,
earthquakes, what have you, the
moment they start. If you ask
me, with a good telescope you
could even spot forest fires the
minute they broke out, not to
mention a sneak bombing on a
target city&mdash;uh, sorry, sir, I forgot."</p>

<p>Dan broke off and almost
retched as his stomach turned a
flip-flop to end all flip-flops. The
VX-3 had reached the peak of
its trajectory at over 1000 miles
altitude and now turned down,
lazily at first. He gulped oxygen
from the emergency tube at his
lips and felt better.</p>

<p>"Turning back on schedule,
Rough Rock. Peak altitude 1037
miles. Everything fine, no danger.
This was all a cinch....
HEY! Wait.... Something not
in the books has popped up ...
stand by!"</p>

<p>Dan had felt the rocket swing
a bit, strangely, as if gripped by
a strong force. Instead of falling
directly down toward Earth with
a slight pitch, it slanted sideways
and spun on its long axis. And
then Dan saw what it was....</p>

<p>Beneath, intercepting his trajectory,
coming around fast over
the curvature of Earth, was a tiny
black worldlet, 998 miles above
Earth. It might be an enormous
meteor, but Dan felt he was
right the first time. For it wasn't
falling like a meteor but swinging
parallel to Earth's surface on
even keel.</p>

<p>He stared at the unexpected
discovery, as amazed as if it were
a fire-breathing dragon out of
legend. For it was, actually, he
realized in swift, stunned comprehension,
more amazing than
any legend.</p>

<p>Dan kept his voice calm.
"Hello, Rough Rock.... Listen ...
nobody expected <i>this</i> ...
hold your hat, sir, and sit down.
I've discovered a <i>second moon</i>
of Earth!... Uhhuh, you heard
me right! a second moon! Tie
that, will you?... Sure, it's
tiny, less than a mile in diameter
I'd say. Dead black in color.
Guess that's why telescopes never
spotted it. Tiny and black,
blends into the black backdrop
of space. It has terrific speed.
And that little maverick's gravitational
field caught my rocket....
Of course it can't yank me
away from Earth gravity, but the
trouble is&mdash;yipe! my rocket and
that moonlet may be in for a
mutual <i>collision</i> course...."</p>

<p>Dan's trained eye suddenly saw
that grim possibility. Barreling
around Earth in a narrow orbit
with a speed of something near
or over 12,000 miles an hour the
tiny new moon had, since his
ascent, charged directly into his
downward free fall. It was a
chance in a thousand for a direct
hit, except for one added factor&mdash;the
moonlet exerted enough
gravity pull out of its many-million
ton bulk to warp the rocket
into its path. And the thousand-to-one
odds were thus wiped out,
becoming even money.</p>

<p>"Nip and tuck," reported Dan,
answering the excited pleadings
and questions from Rough Rock.
"It won't be a head-on crash. I
may even miss entirely.... Oh,
Lord! Not with that spire of rock
sticking up from it.... I'm going
to hit that ..."</p>

<p>Dan had heard an atomic
bomb blast once and it sounded
like a string of them set off at
once as the rocket smashed into
the rocky prominence. The rock
splintered. The rocket splintered.
But Dan was not there to be
splintered likewise. He had
jammed down a button, at the
critical moment, and the rocket's
emergency escape-hatch had
ejected him a split-second before
the violent impact.</p>

<p>But Dan blacked out, receiving
some of the concussion of
the exploding rocket. When his
eyes snapped open he was floating
like a feather in open, airless
space. His rubberoid space
suit, living up to its rigid tests,
had inflated to its elastic limit.
But it held and within its automatic
units began feeding him
oxygen, heat and radio-power.
He had a chance, now, because
he had been ejected cleanly from
the rocket, without damage to the
protective suit.</p>

<p>The stars wheeled dizzily
around him. Dan finally saw the
reason why. He was not just
floating as a free agent in space.
He was circling the black moonlet,
at perhaps a thousand yards
from its pitted surface.</p>

<p>"Hello, Rough Rock," he
called. "Still alive and kicking,
sir. Only now, of all crazy-mad
things, <i>I'm</i> a moon of <i>this</i> moon!
The collision must have knocked
me clear out of my down-to-Earth
orbit.... I must have been
ejected in the same direction as
the moonlet's course, in its gravity
field.... I don't know. Let
an electronic brain figure it out
some time.... Anyway, now
I'm being dragged along in the
orbit of the moonlet&mdash;how about
<i>that</i>? Yes, sir, I'm circling down
closer and closer to the moonlet....
No, don't worry, sir. It
was a weak gravity pull, only a
fraction of an Earth-g. So I'm
drifting down gently as a cloud....
Stand by for my landing on
Earth's second moon!"</p>

<p>The bloated figure in the
bulging space suit circled the
black stony surface several more
times, in a narrowing spiral, and
finally landed with a soft skidding
bump that didn't even jar
Dan's teeth. He bounced several
times from a diminishing height
of fifty-odd feet in grotesque
slow-motion before he finally
came to a stop.</p>

<p>He sat still for a moment, adjusting
to the fantastic fact of
being shipwrecked on an unchartered
moonlet, crowding down
his pulse rate which might be
over ten percent normal now.</p>

<p>"Okay, Rough Rock, I hear
you.... You're telling me, sir?...
Obviously, I'm <i>marooned</i>
here. No rocket to leave with.
No way to get back to terra
firma ... what? If you'll pardon
my saying so, sir, that's a
silly question.... Of course I'm
scared! Scared green. Sorry about
the rocket, sir, losing it for you....
Me, sir? Thank you, sir.
But stop apologizing, will you?
I know you haven't got any
duplicates of the VX-3 ready,
no rescue rocket...."</p>

<p>Dan listened a moment longer
then broke in roughly. "Oh,
for Pete's sake, will you stop crying
over me, sir? So I get mine
here. I might have gotten it
over Berlin, too. Forget it&mdash;sir."</p>

<p>Dan grinned suddenly. "Look,
what have I got to kick about?
I'll go out in a flash of glory&mdash;at
least one headline will put it
that way&mdash;and I'll get credit in
the history books as the man who
discovered that Earth has <i>two</i>
moons! What more could I ask,
really?"</p>

<p>Dan blushed at the reply from
Rough Rock. "Will you lay off
please, Colonel? How else should
a man take it? I'm still scared
silly inside. But, look, I've really
got something to report now.
This little runt moon makes
tracks around Earth in probably
two hours minus. If I remember
my Spacenautics right I'm already
looking down over the
Grand Canyon, heading west.
I'm going to get a pretty terrific
bird's-eye view of the whole
world in two more hours, which
is just about how much oxygen
I've got left.... Lucky, eh?"</p>

<p>Dan looked down, watching in
fascination the majestic wheeling
of the Earth below him. His little
moonlet did not rotate, or
rather it rotated once for each
revolution around Earth, as the
Moon did, keeping one face
earthward, giving him an uninterrupted
view. The Sierras on
Earth hove into clear view and
the broad Pacific. There would
follow Hawaii, then Japan, Asia,
Europe.... No, he saw he was
slanting southwest. It would be
across the equator, past Australia,
perhaps near the South
Pole, then up around over the
top of the world past Greenland,
following that great circle around
the globe. In any case, his was
the speediest trip around the
world ever made by man!</p>

<p>"Before we're out of mutual
range, Rough Rock, I'm going to
explore this new moon. Me and
Columbus! Stand by for reports."</p>

<p>Dan did his walking in huge
leaps that propelled him fifty feet
at a step with slight effort, due
to the extremely feeble gravity of
the tiny body. What did he weigh
here? Probably no more than
an ounce or two.</p>

<p>"Nothing much to report,
Colonel. It's a dead, airless pip-squeak
planetoid, just a big mile-thick
rock, probably. No life, no
vegetation, no people, no nothing.
Guess you might call me the Man
in the Second Moon&mdash;and the
joke's on me! Well, one and
three-quarter hours of oxygen left,
by the gauge, or 105 minutes&mdash;sounds
like more that way....
What's that, sir? Your voice is
getting faint. Any last requests
from me? Well, one favor maybe.
Pick up my body some day
with another rocket.... Yeah,
it'll stay preserved up here in
this deep-freeze of space....
Thanks, sir.... Can't hear you
much now. Going out of range.
Give Betty my fondest. You
know, the blonde.... Well, sir&mdash;goodbye
now."</p>

<p>Dan was glad that Rough
Rock's radio voice faded to a
whispery nothingness. It wasn't
easy to stay casual now. There
was nothing more to say, really,
and he didn't want to hear any
more crying from the CO. The
Old Man had sounded almost
hysterical. He wanted just to be
alone with his thoughts now,
making his final peace with the
universe....</p>

<p>He checked the gauge with his
watch&mdash;ninety minutes of oxygen
to zero. Or, he thought with a
grin, eternity minus ninety
minutes.</p>

<p>He was beginning to have
trouble breathing. But it was
awesomely grand, watching the
sweep of Earth beneath him, the
procession of dots that were
islands strung across the Pacific
South Seas like a necklace of
green beads. He was still within
radio range of ships below at sea.
Yet he didn't contact them. He
had nothing to say, like a ghost
in the sky.</p>

<p>Idly, he kept pitching loose
stones, watching their rifle-like
speed away from him. Again a
phenomenon of the weak gravity
of the moonlet. Actually, he was
able to pick up a boulder ten feet
across and heave it away with
ease. <i>We who are about to die
amuse ourselves</i>, he thought.
Then, because a thread of stubborn
hope still clung in a corner
of his mind, he got an idea. It
had lurked just beyond his mental
grasp for some time now. Something
significant....</p>

<p>Abruptly, face alight, Dan
switched on his radio and contacted
a ship below, asking them
to relay him to Rough Rock with
their more powerful transmitter.</p>

<p>"Ahoy, Rough Rock! Stop
adding up my insurance, Colonel!
I'm coming back.... No, sir, I
haven't gone out of my head,
sir. It's so simple it's a laugh,
sir.... See you in a few hours,
sir!"</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p>Dan grinned when they hauled
his dripping form from the sea.
Aboard the search plane they cut
him out of the space suit to which
was still attached his emergency
twin parachute. But his helmet
was gone, ripped loose, for Dan
had been breathing fresh Earth
air during the long parachute
descent.</p>

<p>They stared at him as at a dead
man come alive.</p>

<p>"Impossible to escape?" He
chuckled, repeating their babble.
"That's what <i>I</i> thought too, until
I remembered those data tables
on gravity and Escape Velocity
and such&mdash;how, on the Moon,
the Escape Velocity is much less
than on Earth. And on that tiny
second moon&mdash;well, my clue was
when I threw a stone into the air
<i>and it never came back</i>."</p>

<p>Dan gulped hot coffee.</p>

<p>"I got off the moonlet myself
then, got up to more than a mile
above it where I was free of its
feeble gravity. But I was still in
the same orbit circling Earth.
I'd have continued revolving as
a human satellite forever, of
course, but for this emergency
gadget hooked to my belt."</p>

<p>Dan held up the metal gun with
its empty tank and needle-nose
half burned away.</p>

<p>"Reaction pistol. Fires hydrazine
and oxidizer, ordinary jet-rocket
principle. Aiming it toward
the stars, opposite earth, its reactive
blasts shoved me Earthward,
thanks to Newton. I needed
a speed of about one-half mile a
second. The powerful little jet
gun had only my small mass to
shove in free space, without
gravity or friction. That broke
me from free-fall <i>around</i> Earth
to gravity-fall <i>toward</i> Earth.</p>

<p>"Then I spiraled down under
gravity pull. I reached lung-filling
air density just in time, before my
oxygen gave out. One more
danger was that I began heating
up like a meteor due to air friction.
I flung out a prayer first,
followed by my twin parachutes,
designed for extreme initial shock.
They held. Slowed me to a paratrooper's
drift the rest of the way
down."</p>

<p>"Wait," a puzzled pilot objected.
"Your story doesn't hang
together. <i>How</i> did you get off
that moonlet? How did you get
up there, a mile above it, away
from its gravity? There was nobody
to throw <i>you</i>, like a stone."</p>

<p>"I threw myself," said Dan.
"First I ran as fast as I could,
maybe halfway around that moonlet,
to get a good running start.
And then&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dan Barstow's grin then was
undoubtedly the biggest grin in
history....</p>

<p>"Well, then, since the feeble
gravity couldn't pull me back
again, what I really did was to
<i>jump clear off that moon</i>."</p>
